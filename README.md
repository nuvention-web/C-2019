# C-2019

To run our app, you need to use Expo (since we are still in the process of getting our app in the Apple app store).
1) Go to https://expo.io/ and make an account. 
2) With an IPhone, go to the Apple app store and download the Expo app. 
3) Log into the phone app with your new account. 
4) On your computer, clone/pull the Github repo (master branch).
5) Use npm to install Expo "npm i expo-cli".
6) Type "npm install" to install all packages and dependencies. 
7) Type "expo start" to run the app through expo. This should bring up a tab in your browser running on local host. 
8) This tab should show it downloading the Javascript bundle. To open the app on your phone, go to your Iphone camera app and scan the QR code on the left of the screen. If it is not working, try switching the connection from LAN to Tunnel (on the left of the screen). 
9) A notification should pop up (likely at the top of your screen) prompting you to open to Expo app. Click on this prompt. 
10) The app should be loaded and you should see the Login screen. You can create an account if you would like, or use our demo account (username: demo@gmail.com, password: demo123). This will let you explore the app on the end of the novice grower.
11) If you would like to test the consulting feature, have someone else log into the app using the consultant credentials (username: growiydotcom@gmail.com, password: NUVention2019). On the consultant end, you can look up user timelines and plants on the home screen tab. On the consultant tab, you can select a user from a list  (by their email) to pull up their consulting chat.
